Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client requested the design of a web version for "Draw It or Lose It," a multi-platform gaming experience that allows multiple teams to play simultaneously, each having multiple players. The design leverages a singleton pattern to ensure a single game instance in memory, which helps in maintaining unique identifiers for games, teams, and players, facilitating a consistent user experience across devices and browsers.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, a particular strength was the detailed evaluation of each operating platform's characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses, providing a comprehensive analysis to inform the client's decision on platform selection. This evaluation considered factors like security, cost, compatibility, and performance, among others, for Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile devices.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through the design document was helpful as it structured the approach to addressing client requirements, from conceptualization to recommendation. It facilitated a holistic view of the project, ensuring all aspects, including user experience, technical constraints, and platform-specific considerations, were addressed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If a revision were to be made, it might involve refining the section on distributed systems and networks. Enhancing the detail on how to implement microservices architecture, API Gateway, and other technologies could provide clearer guidance on building a scalable and efficient backend for the game.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were interpreted by focusing on a consistent and engaging multi-user experience across various platforms, emphasizing real-time interactions, unique game instances, and seamless gameplay. Considering user needs is crucial as it directly impacts the game's usability, engagement, and overall success.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The software was designed by evaluating the client's requirements against each platform's capabilities, employing strategies like modular design for scalability, and choosing programming languages and tools that support cross-platform development. Future projects would benefit from a similar analytical approach, emphasizing modular design, detailed platform evaluation, and user-centric development.
